1
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:05,297
MR. TRASK: I'm going to recommend 
to the disciplinary committee

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,878
that you be expelled, Mr. Simms.

3
00:00:07,878 --> 00:00:11,666
You are a cover-up artist and you are a liar.

4
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,975
But not a snitch!

5
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,523
Excuse me?

6
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:18,313
No, I don't think I will.

7
00:00:18,313 --> 00:00:19,529
Mr. Slade...

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,772
This is such a crock of shit.

9
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:29,345
Please watch your language, Mr. Slade. 
You are in the Baird School not a barracks.

10
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:32,012
Mr. Simms, I will give you one final opportunity to speak up.

11
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:35,056
Mr. Simms doesn't want it.

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:39,424
He doesn't need to labeled: "Still worthy of being a 'Baird Man.'"

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,516
What the hell is that?

14
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:43,517
What is your motto here?

15
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:47,805
"Boys, inform on your classmates, save your hide"

16
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:51,181
Anything short of that we're gonna burn you at the stake?

17
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,504
Well, gentlemen

18
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:58,755
when the shit hits the fan some guys run 
and some guys stay.

19
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:04,597
Here's Charlie facing the fire
and there's George hiding in big Daddy's pocket.

20
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,470
And what are you doing?

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,196
You're gonna award George and destroy Charlie.

22
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,690
Are you finished Mr. Slade?

23
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,996
No, I'm just gettin' warmed up.

24
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:19,154
I don't know who went to this place,

25
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:23,869
William Howard Taft, William Jennings Bryan, 
 William Tell -- whoever.

26
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,625
Their spirit is dead, if they ever had one, it's gone.

27
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,670
You're building a rat ship here.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,508
A vessel for sea going snitches.

29
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:40,009
And if you think you're preparing 
these minnows for manhood you better think again.

30
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:47,083
Because I say you are killing 
the very spirit this institution proclaims it instills!

31
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,763
What a sham!

32
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:51,785
What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?

33
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:55,404
I mean, the only class in this act is sitting next to me

34
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:59,176
And I'm here to tell you this boy's soul is intact.

35
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,788
It's non-negotiable. You know how I know?

36
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:06,447
Someone here, and I'm not gonna say who, 
offered to buy it.

37
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:08,299
Only Charlie here wasn't selling.

38
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:12,082
- Sir, you're out of order.
- Out of order? I'll show you out of order!

39
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:15,024
You don't know what outta order is, Mr. Trask!

40
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:19,937
I'd show you but I'm too old, 
I'm too tired, I'm too fucking blind.

41
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:22,728
If I were the man I was five years ago

42
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:24,728
I'd take a flamethrower to this place!

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,897
Out of order. Who the hell you think you're talking to?

44
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:35,927
I've been around, you know?

45
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:38,790
There was a time I could see.

46
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,866
And I have seen

47
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:47,037
boys like these, younger than these, 
their arms torn out, their legs ripped off.

48
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:52,166
But there isn't nothing like 
the sight of an amputated spirit

49
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:56,859
There is...no prosthetic for that.

50
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:00,341
You think you're merely sending this splendid foot-soldier

51
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:03,648
back home to Oregon with his tail between his legs,

52
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:07,884
but I say you are executing his soul!

53
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:11,094
And why?

54
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:14,149
Because he's not a Baird man.

55
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,740
Baird men.

56
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,940
You hurt this boy, you're going to be Baird bums, 
the lot of you.

57
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,978
And Harry, Jimmy, Trent, wherever you are out there

58
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,687
Fuck you too!

59
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:32,000
[BANGS GAVEL] Stand down Mr. Slade!

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,669
I'm not finished!

61
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:38,951
As I came in here, I heard those words

62
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:42,253
"Cradle of leadership"

63
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:46,099
Well, when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall.

64
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,192
And it has fallen here, it has fallen.

65
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:52,475
Makers of men, creators of leaders,

66
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:56,692
be careful what kind of leaders you're producing here.

67
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:01,090
I don't know if Charlie's silence here today is right or wrong.

68
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,515
I'm not a judge or jury. But I can tell you this:

69
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:09,533
He won't sell anybody out to buy his future!

70
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:13,678
And that, my friends, is called integrity.

71
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,617
That's called courage.

72
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:19,262
Now that's the stuff leaders should be made of.

73
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:29,143
Now, I have come to the crossroads in my life.

74
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:33,392
I always knew what the right path was.

75
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,764
Without exception, I knew.

76
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:39,277
But I never took it. You know why?

77
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:42,373
It was too damn hard.

78
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:47,250
Now here's Charlie. He's come to the crossroads.

79
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,416
He has chosen a path.

80
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,623
It's the right path.

81
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:55,959
It's a path made of principle that leads to character.

82
00:04:58,217 --> 00:05:00,603
Let him continue on his journey.

83
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:07,445
You hold this boy's future in your hands, committee.

84
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:10,270
It's a valuable future.

85
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,284
Believe me.

86
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:15,309
Don't destroy it. Protect it.

87
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,700
Embrace it.

88
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:22,704
It's gonna make you proud one day. I promise you.
